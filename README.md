<h1>CSCI620 - Introduction to Big Data Project</h1>
CSCI620 Project Repository<br>

This repository is a collection of JS, Python and SQL scripts to load and perform analysis on the MyAnimeList dataset from Kaggle for the CSCI620 Course project for Spring 2023.Data loading, analysis and comparisons performed between MySQL and MongoDB<br>
Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azathoth42/myanimelist

- Project split between 3 phases.
- Please refer to each Phase report for information.
- Each subsequent phase assumes previous phase has been executed and the data is present in the postgreSQL and MongoDB

<h2>Phase 1</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This phase deals with selecting a viable dataset to load and perform analysis on.</li>
  <li>Please refer to <b>CSCI620 - Report Phase 1.pdf</b> for more information and script execution.</li>
  <li>The Objectives of this phase include -
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select one or more datasets. The final dataset needs to be large (~50M tuples in a
        relational database), and interesting enough so you can perform meaningful queries and mine
        meaningful information from it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide a description of the data and a meaningful relational model to faithfully represent the dataset.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide a program to load the dataset.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
